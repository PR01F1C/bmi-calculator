# Multi-Calculator

This repository contains a simple yet versatile web application with multiple calculators, including a BMI calculator, a weight converter, and a length converter. This project serves as a foundational step into creating online web applications.

## Project Overview

The Multi-Calculator web application offers the following features:
- **BMI Calculator**: Calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) based on height and weight, providing separate results for males and females.
- **Weight Converter**: Converts weight between kilograms (kg) and pounds (lbs).
- **Length Converter**: Converts length between centimeters (cm) and feet/inches, allowing detailed input for both units.

## Calculators and Converters

### BMI Calculator

The BMI Calculator takes into account the user's height and weight to calculate the BMI and categorize it into different health categories for both males and females. It provides a visual marker on a scale to help users understand their BMI range.

### Weight Converter

The Weight Converter allows users to enter a weight value and convert it between kilograms and pounds, facilitating quick and easy conversions.

### Length Converter

The Length Converter allows users to enter a length value and convert it between centimeters and feet/inches. Users can choose to input their length as a single value in centimeters or as separate values for feet and inches.

## Usage Instructions

1. **BMI Calculator**:
   - Enter your height and select the unit (cm or inches).
   - Enter your weight and select the unit (kg or lbs).
   - Click on "Calculate BMI" to get the result. The BMI value and category will be displayed for both males and females.

2. **Weight Converter**:
   - Enter the weight value.
