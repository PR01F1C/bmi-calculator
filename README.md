# Multi-Calculator

This repository contains a simple web application with multiple calculators, including a BMI calculator, a weight converter, and a length converter. This project serves as a first step into creating online web applications.

## Project Overview

The Multi-Calculator web application includes the following features:
- **BMI Calculator**: Calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) based on height, weight, and gender.
- **Weight Converter**: Converts weight between kilograms (kg) and pounds (lbs).
- **Length Converter**: Converts length between centimeters (cm) and feet/inches.

## Calculators and Converters

### BMI Calculator

The BMI Calculator takes into account the user's height, weight, and gender to calculate the BMI and categorize it as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obesity.

### Weight Converter

The Weight Converter allows users to enter a weight value and convert it between kilograms and pounds.

### Length Converter

The Length Converter allows users to enter a length value and convert it between centimeters and feet/inches. The user can choose between entering a single value in centimeters or separate values for feet and inches.

## Usage

1. **BMI Calculator**:
   - Enter your height and select the unit (cm or inches).
