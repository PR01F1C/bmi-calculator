        <h2 id="bmi">Body Mass Index (BMI)</h2>
        <h3 id="definition">Definition</h3>
        <p>BMI is a value derived from the weight and height of a person. It is calculated by dividing a person's weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters (kg/mÂ²). This formula provides a simple numeric measure of a person's thickness or thinness, which allows health professionals to discuss weight problems more objectively.</p>
        
        <h3 id="calculation">Calculation</h3>
        <p>To calculate BMI:</p>
        <pre>BMI = Weight (kg) / Height (m)<sup>2</sup></pre>
        <p>For example, a person weighing 70 kg and with a height of 1.75 meters would have a BMI of:</p>
        <pre>BMI = 70 / (1.75)<sup>2</sup> = 22.86</pre>
        
        <h3 id="classifications">BMI Classifications</h3>
        <p>BMI values are categorized to determine weight status and associated health risks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Underweight: Less than 18.5</li>
            <li>Healthy weight: 18.5 to 24.9</li>
            <li>Overweight but not obese: 25 to 29.9</li>
            <li>Obese class I: 30 to 34.9</li>
            <li>Obese class II: 35 to 39.9</li>
            <li>Obese class III: 40 or more</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3 id="exceptions">Exceptions and Adjustments</h3>
        <p>The healthy weight BMI range can vary for specific populations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Lower for people of Asian background</li>
            <li>Higher for people of Polynesian background, older adults, elite athletes with higher levels of lean body tissue, and pregnant women.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3 id="limitations">Limitations</h3>
        <p>BMI does not differentiate between muscle and fat mass, potentially misclassifying muscular individuals as overweight or obese and underestimating body fat in some cases. Additionally, while the BMI calculation is the same for both men and women, the interpretation can differ slightly due to differences in body composition. Men typically have more muscle mass, while women generally have a higher percentage of body fat.</p>

        <h2 id="waist">Waist Measurement</h2>
        <h3 id="importance">Importance</h3>
        <p>Waist measurement is used alongside BMI to provide a more comprehensive assessment of health risks. A higher waist size indicates internal fat deposits, increasing the risk of chronic conditions such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and some cancers.</p>
        
        <h3 id="risk">Risk Thresholds</h3>
        <p>Men:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Increased risk: 94 cm or more</li>
            <li>Greatly increased risk: 102 cm or more</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Women:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Increased risk: 80 cm or more</li>
            <li>Greatly increased risk: 88 cm or more</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3 id="measuring">Measuring Your Waist</h3>
        <p>To measure your waist accurately:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Remove bulky clothing, loosen your belt, and empty your pockets.</li>
            <li>Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.</li>
            <li>Wrap a tape measure around your belly, in line with your belly button, ensuring it's loose enough to fit one finger inside the tape.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 id="history">History of BMI</h2>
        <h3 id="origins">Origins</h3>
        <p>BMI was devised by Adolphe Quetelet between 1830 and 1850 as part of his work on "social physics." Initially called the Quetelet Index, it was never intended for medical use but rather to discover the socially ideal human physique. The modern term "body mass index" was coined by Ancel Keys in a 1972 paper.</p>
        
        <h3 id="modern-use">Modern Use</h3>
        <p>Despite its limitations, BMI is widely used for preliminary diagnoses due to its simplicity. It has become a standard for recording obesity statistics and assessing general health trends within populations.</p>
        
        <h3 id="international">International Variations</h3>
        <p>BMI classifications and cut-off points can vary globally. For example, the Hospital Authority of Hong Kong and the Japan Society for the Study of Obesity have different thresholds for overweight and obesity.</p>
        
        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>BMI and waist measurements are valuable tools in health assessments, providing insight into potential health risks associated with weight. However, they should be used in conjunction with other measures and clinical evaluations to obtain a comprehensive understanding of an individual's health status.</p>
